Some additional patches are required to be applied to the Zephyr kernel
for building the open source EC App. The current EC App is based out of
Zephyr v2.5 and hence these patches need to be applied on that branch.
These patches are expected to be part of the future Zephyr releases (if
they are not already integrated).

Note: Below steps assume environment has been setup as indicated in the
main Intel Open source EC FW documentation.


1) Check out the main branch
cd ecfw-zephyr
git checkout main

2) Apply zephyr patches on to the kernel branch
cd ../ecfwwork/zephyr_fork
git am ../../ecfw-zephyr/zephyr_patches/patches_v2_5.patch

3) Building the code for ADL-S (for e.g)
cd ../../ecfw-zephyr
west build  -c -p always -b mec1501_adl
